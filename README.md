## Overview üåü

This workflow automates the new hire onboarding process by:
- Generating a secure, random password via an Azure Function üîê
- Provisioning a user account in Microsoft Entra ID üë•
- Stores user resumes in SharePoint/OneDrive üìÅ
- Sending final notifications to relevant parties üìß

By integrating Microsoft Power Automate with Azure and Office 365 services, the process minimizes manual intervention and ensures consistency and security.

## Architecture & Components ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Power Automate Flow:** The central workflow engine.
- **Azure Function:** A Python-based service to generate a random secure password.
- **Microsoft Entra ID Connector:** Provisions new user accounts.
- **Office 365 Connectors:** - Stores user resumes in SharePoint/OneDrive
- **SharePoint/OneDrive:** Stores document templates and final personalized documents.

## **Flow Architecture**

## Workflow Steps üîÑ

### 1. Trigger & Data Collection

- **Trigger:**  
  The flow is initiated when a new response is received (e.g., from a Microsoft Form).
- **Data Collected:**  
  Employee details such as First Name, Last Name, Email, etc.

---

### 2. Generate Secure Password with Azure Function

An Azure Function generates the secure password. Use the following Python code:

```python
import azure.functions as func
import logging
import json
import random
import string

app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)

@app.route(route="passGenerate")
def passGenerate(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Password generation function processed a request.')
    
    # Check for an optional 'length' parameter. Default length is 12 if not provided.
    try:
        length = int(req.params.get("length", 12))
    except ValueError:
        return func.HttpResponse(
            json.dumps({"error": "Invalid length provided. Please enter a number."}),
            status_code=400,
            mimetype="application/json"
        )

    # Define the characters allowed in the password and generate a random password.
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    
    # Build a JSON formatted response.
    response_data = {"password": password}
    return func.HttpResponse(
        json.dumps(response_data),
        status_code=200,
        mimetype="application/json"
    )
```

---

## 3. Process the HTTP Response

- **Parse JSON Action:**  
  Use the Parse JSON step in Power Automate to extract the `password` field from the Azure Function's response.

- **Direct Usage:**  
  The parsed password field becomes available as dynamic content for subsequent actions. üì≤

---

## 4. Automated User Provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID

Provision the new user account using the Microsoft Entra ID **"Create user"** action:

1. **Add the "Create user" Action in Power Automate.**

2. **Fill in the Required Fields:**

   - **Account Enabled:**  
     Set to `true`.
   - **Display Name:**  
   - **Mail Nickname:**  
   - **User Principal Name (UPN):**  
   - **Password:**  
   - **Given Name & Surname:**  

---

## 5. Manage User Documents (e.g., Resume)

This section focuses on managing user documents such as resumes. The process takes the resume from the submitted form and stores it in the SharePoint/OneDrive.

### 5.1. Prepare Resume Templates

- **Store:**  
  Save the resume template in SharePoint or OneDrive so that Power Automate can access and update it when needed. üìÅ

1. **Create the Final Resume Document:**  
   Use the **"Create file"** action to save the populated resume to a designated SharePoint or OneDrive folder.

2. **Distribution:**  
   Optionally, send the resume via email as an attachment or provide a downloadable link for HR review.
---

## 6. Final Notifications

Notify the new hire and/or relevant teams about the successful onboarding.

- **Send an Email Action:**  
  Configure the Office 365 Outlook **"Send an email (V2)"** action with the following details:

  - **Recipients:**  
    New employee's email or the HR/IT team.

  - **Subject:**  
    "Welcome to [Your Company] ‚Äì Your New Account Details"

  - **Body:**  
    Include the UPN, temporary password, and a link or attachment of the personalized document.

### Example Email Body:
```plaintext
Hello [FirstName],

Welcome to [Your Company]!

Your account has been created successfully.

Username: [User Principal Name]
Temporary Password: [Generated Password]

Please change your password at first sign-in.

Attached is your personalized welcome document.

Best regards,
IT Team
```
